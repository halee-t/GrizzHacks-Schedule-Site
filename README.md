# GrizzHacks-Schedule-Site

This is a project that I created in preparation for my University's Hackathon. We wanted a way to be able to display a countdown of how long the hackers have until their project must be completed, a description of the event that is currently happening, and a description of what event is coming up. This site is set to the dates of our hackathon, but their is commented out code if you would like to use a test time and manipulate it that way. 

The schedule displays the main name of the event, a description (if needed), the start and end time, and the location. If two events are occuring at once, then they will be displayed one on top of the other. We never had more than 2 at once, so that is currently all it is set up to handle.

The purpose of this site is to be displayed on a projector, so there is also no mobile version.
